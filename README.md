# Hilton's Deep Learning Curriculum
A repository for the assignments from [Jacob Hilton's Deep Learning Curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum) that I have completed. 
I may go beyond the first chapter if I have more time in the future.  

## Chapter 1: Transformers  
Implement a decoder-only transformer from scratch and train it on the complete works of Shakespeare.
